# ignogenous-zones

Ignogenous Zones is a series of webpages standing for various parts of the human body. All webpages reflect on body parts that have a great potential for sexual stimulus. Erogenous zones in mainstream culture are often reduced to what is called the sexual centre or more specifically the genitals. This “sex-center” is only a part of what can be sexually stimulated in the body. This centered view on only the genitals is made from the biased perspective of an abled-cis-body. These five webpages are only a beginning of these unseen erogenous zones. In addition to the spine, finger, back of the knee, earlobe and armpit, there are many more areas of the body to explore. All parts that can possibly serve different sensations for different people. Feel invited to try out these zones yourself and explore how they function for you.
